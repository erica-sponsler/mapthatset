BinaryAndDistinctMapper - Maps exactly half of the set to a binary mapping, and the other half to a distinct mapping.  Which half is mapped to what type of map is determined randomly.

BinaryAndRandomMapper - Maps exactly half of the set to a binary mapping, and the other half to a random mapping.  Which half is mapped to what type of map is determined randomly.

BinaryMapper - Maps all numbers in the set to one of two values.  The cardinality of the mapping is 2.

DistinctMapper - Maps all numbers to distinct values.  The cardinality of the starting set and the map are both N.

MapToXMapper - Maps all numbers in the set to one of X values.  X is set internally.  The cardinality of the mapping is X.

RandomBinaryAndDistinctMapper - Maps a random number of the set to a binary mapping, and the rest to a distinct mapping.

RandomBinaryAndRandomMapper - Maps a random number of the set to a binary mapping, and the rest to a random mapping.

RandomMapper - Maps all numbers in the set to random values.
